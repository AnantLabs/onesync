#summary How file metadata and SyncJob are stored

= Database Schema =

== `SyncSource_Info` Table ==
  * `source_id`: Foreign key. Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)
  * `absolute_path`: To be concatenated with `relative_path` column of the Metadata table to obtain the full absolute path of the file.

Note that the !SyncSource is identified by its id and not its relative path. This is so as to allow multiple !SyncJob to be created for any particular directory.

== `SyncJob` Table ==
  * `pid`: Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)
  * `pname`: Unique !SyncJob name
  * `intermediate_storage_path`: Absolute path to intermediary storage
  * `source_info`: Foreign key. The column `pname` is unique as well

== `Metadata` Table ==
