#summary One Sync High Level Design

== Overview ==

The UI will with interact with !SyncClient and !SyncAgent. !SyncClient is a controller class which manages all providers for business objects and !SyncAgent is the class that handles the synchronization.

The business objects are
  * !SyncJob
  * !SyncSource
  * !SyncActions
  * !FileMetadata

== Provider Class ==

All the providers i.e. SyncSourceProvider, SyncActionsProvider, MetadataProvider as well as SyncJobManager are abtract classes. These classes are responsible for persisting objects that they manage to storage.

In current implementation. SQLite database is for data persistence, and classes that inherits from them these abstract classes are prefixed with 'SQLite'.
