The UI will interact with !SyncClient and !SyncAgent. !SyncClient is a controller class which manages all providers for business objects and !SyncAgent is the class that handles the synchronization.

== Provider Class ==

All the providers i.e. SyncSourceProvider, SyncActionsProvider, MetadataProvider as well as SyncJobManager are abtract classes. These classes are responsible for managing the storage of persistent objects.

In the current implementation, the SQLite database used for data persistence, and classes that inherits from them these abstract classes are prefixed with 'SQLite'.
