==Getting Started==
===The OneSync Concepts===
OneSync is working based on two important concepts. These are the two concepts that make OneSync different from other sync tools such as Live Mesh, Sync Toy and so on.

The first concept is called the *Light-weight Sync*. OneSync is trying to make optimal use of the intermediate storage. Hence, only your modified files will actually be uploaded to or downloaded from the intermediate storage. This will not only prevent storing duplicated copies of your files on the intermediate storage but also make the whole sync process faster.

The second concept is known as *Half Way Sync*. Instead of doing synchronization directly between two PCs, there is an intermediate storage playing an important role during the sync process.

When a user sync his folder, he must first choose the location of his intermediate storage. The storage can be a folder in his portable drive, a Windows Shared Folder or a DropBox local folder that is stored on his computer. When he does the sync on one PC, his files (or *patch*) will be sent to the intermediate storage. After that, he has to do the sync again in his another computer in order to download the *patch* from the intermediate storage and complete the sync process. It is important that the user chooses the same folder as the intermediate storage in subsequent rounds of sync for this couple of folders  on two different PCs.

 # Multiple Jobs Synchronization - Sync more than one sync job sequentially.
 # Sync Preview - View the actions in advance before the sync process.
 # Sync Job Management - Compared to the previous version, this version allows you to create and manage your sync jobs in an easy way. You do not have to memorize the long directories anymore.
 # Right-click and Sync - Just right click any reasonable folder, and you will be able to sync it in just three clicks!

===Getting Around===
The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see in the first window, aka *Sync Job Page*, of OneSync:

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync(V0.9)%20Profile%20Page.jpg]

 # *Sync Job Name* - The name of your new/existing sync job.
 # *Folder To Sync* - The directory shown above is the directory of the folder that you are going to sync later. Hence, the folder is your *Sync Source Folder*.
 # *Intermediate Storage Location* - The location of intermediate storage folder, for example a folder in your thumb drive or DropBox.
 # *Add New Job* - Add the new sync job to your collection of sync jobs so that you can do the same job again in the future.
 # *Check Box* - Check all the sync jobs that you are going to sync.
 # *+ or -* - Sort your sync jobs. This is important if you plan to carry out more than one sync job. The sync job at the top always gets synced first.
 # *Edit, Preview, Show Log* - The three basic operations on a sync job. You can edit your sync job name and folder directories, preview the sync actions that will be carried out and show the log.
 # *Sync Selected Jobs* - Click it to sync only the selected jobs.

The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see when you click on the *Edit* button:
[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync(V0.9)%20Sync%20Job%20Management%20Page.jpg]

 # *New Job Name* - The name of your sync job.
 # *Folder to Sync* - Can update the sync source folder here.
 # *Intermediate Storage Location* - Can update the intermediate storage location here.
 # *Edit Job* - Confirm edit the sync job.
 # *Delete Job* - Delete the job.

The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see when you click on the *Preview* button:
[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync(V0.9)%20Sync%20Preview%20Page.jpg]

 # *Filter* - Filter the sync action that will be carried out.
 # *Skip* - Can choose to skip syncing certain files.
 # *Conflict Resolution* - The way to resolve the conflict, if any.
 # *Done* - Save and close the window.

The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see in the next window, aka *Sync Page*, of OneSync when you click on the *Sync Selected Jobs* button:
[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync(V0.9)%20Sync%20Page.jpg]

 # *Back to Home* - Back to the *Sync Job Page* without doing the sync.
 # *Sync* - The only one button that you need to click to start syncing.
 # *Sync Process* - Only available when you are doing the sync. You can see what the program is doing and what files are being synced.


==Syncing My Folders==
Why put your files in different PCs and keep doing copy-and-paste whenever you update the files? Keep them synchronized between your two computers and you will always have the most up-to-date versions at hand.
===Syncing Through Portable Drive===
*Step 1*

Make sure you have plugged in the portable drive (or thumb drive) to your computer. From your PC, right-click the folder you want to sync, and then click "Sync This Folder with OneSync". Depending on the version you use, the name will be a bit different.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_03.jpg]

In OneSync V1.0, there is another option called "Open OneSync V1.0" which allows you to run the OneSync directly.

*Step 2*

The OneSync Window will pop up. Enter the profile name, directory of the folder to sync and directory of intermediate storage and click on the "Add New Job" button. After that, you can just click on the "Sync Selected Jobs" to start syncing your newly created sync job.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_04.jpg]

*Step 3*

Now, the program will navigate to a new screen (aka *Sync Page*). Here, you just need to click on the 'Sync' button to start syncing.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_05.jpg]

After a few seconds (unless your sync source folder is huge), sync process will be successfully done. =)

===Syncing Through Drop Box===

Firstly, please install DropBox. You can find the installer at https://www.dropbox.com/downloading.

The steps are same as the steps mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive. However, please remember that the intermediate storage path has to be your DropBox folder directory. If you do not know what is your DropBox folder, double click on the DropBox icon on your system tray and then the DropBox folder will be displayed.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_06.jpg]

===Syncing Through Windows Shared Folders===
If you do not bring your portable drive and also do not want to install DropBox, you may want to use a Windows Share Folder as your intermediate storage as well. Of course, the steps to do this are same as those mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive.

Of course, you need to setup a Windows Shared Folder in your LAN first.

===Handling Conflicts===
You can choose different ways to handle the conflicts in the *Preview* window before you do the synchronization.

==What You Should Not Do==
In order to make sure that OneSync is working, you should not perform the following actions in the OneSync.
 * Delete the data.md file.
 * Delete the intermediate storage.

If you accidentally delete the intermediate storage folder or accidentally edit/delete the data.md, then you should delete the profile which is associated to the intermediate storage folder in OneSync under Sync Job Management.

==Error Messages==
Sometimes, you will see an error message displayed on the top of the window. It is highly possible that due to one of these problems:
 * You create a new job name having the same name as one of the existing sync jobs (Just choose a new name that you have not used before).
 * There are more than one profile which have the same intermediate storage (Do not use back the same intermediate storage for different profile).
 * The data.md file is missing (Please uninstall and re-install).
 * The data.md file is not updated because of the IO problem (Please try run the program later).
 * A problem that the CodeDroids members do not even know (Please tell us).
