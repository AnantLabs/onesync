==Syncing My Folders==
Why put your files in different PCs and keep doing copy-and-paste when you update the files? Keep them synchronized between your two computers, so you always have the most up-to-date versions at hand.
===Syncing Through Portable Drive===
*Step 1*

Make sure you have plugged in the portable drive (or thumb drive) to your computer. From your PC, right-click the folder you want to sync, and then click "Sync This Folder with OneSync". Depends on the version you use, the name will be a bit different.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_03.jpg]

*Step 2*

The OneSync Window will pop up. Enter your profile name and click on the "Do Job" button.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_04.jpg]

*Step 3*

Now, the program will navigate to a new screen (aka *Sync Page*) where you can enter the FULL path to your intermediate storage. After that, just click on the 'Sync' button to start syncing.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_05.jpg]

Now, you just need to sit in front of your computer to wait for the sync job to be completely done.

===Syncing Through Drop Box===
Firstly, please install DropBox. You can find the installer at https://www.dropbox.com/downloading.

The steps are same as the steps mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive. However, please remember that the intermediate storage path has to be your DropBox folder directory. If you do not know what is your DropBox folder, double click on the DropBox icon on your system tray.

===Syncing Through Windows Shared Folders===
If you do not bring your portable drive and you do not want to install DropBox, you can actually use a Windows Share Folder as your intermediate storage as well. Of course, the steps to do this are same as the steps mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive.

Of course, you need to setup a Windows Shared Folder in your LAN first.

==Managing Sync Jobs==
===Creating A New Sync Job===
In the *Sync Job Page*, you can create a new sync job by entering the name for your new sync job and press the "Do Job" button. However, please remember that the sync job is meaningless if there is no intermediate storage assigned to it. Hence, the sync job is only created when you do the sync, i.e. pressing the "Sync" button on the *Sync Page*.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_04.jpg]

Next time, when you are going to sync the same folder again, then you can just select the profile from the drop-down list in the *Sync Job Page*.

===Modifying My Existing Sync Job===
In the *Sync Job Page*, select existing sync job by either keying in the name (our system will auto-complete the name for you if the profile exists) or selecting the profile from the drop-down list.

After that, you will see that there will be a few options appearing below. From there, you can either edit the name of the selected existing profile by keying in the new name and pressing the "Rename Job".

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_07.jpg]

===Deleting Existing Sync Job===
You can permanently delete any existing sync job easily by selecting an existing sync job and pressing the "Delete This Job".

==View The Logs==
After you sync or when you are going to sync an existing profile, you will be able to view the logs of past sync process. The logs include the records from all profiles which are attached to the *Sync Source Folder*.

To view the logs, just press on the "Show Log" button in the *Sync Page*.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_08.jpg]

The logs will be shown in your default browser.
