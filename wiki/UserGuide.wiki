==Syncing My Folders==
Why put your files in different PCs and keep doing copy-and-paste when you update the files? Keep them synchronized between your two computers, so you always have the most up-to-date versions at hand.
===Syncing Through Portable Drive===
*Step 1*

Make sure you have plugged in the portable drive (or thumb drive) to your computer. From your PC, right-click the folder you want to sync, and then click "Sync This Folder with OneSync". Depends on the version you use, the name will be a bit different.

*Step 2*

The OneSync Window will pop up. Enter your profile name and click on the "Do Job" button.

*Step 3*

Now, the program will navigate to a new screen where you can enter the FULL path to your intermediate storage. After that, just click on the 'Sync' button to start syncing.

Now, you just need to sit in front of your computer to wait for the sync job to be completely done.

===Syncing through DropBox===
Firstly, please install DropBox. You can find the installer at https://www.dropbox.com/downloading.

The steps are same as the steps mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive. However, please remember that the intermediate storage path has to be your DropBox folder directory. If you do not know what is your DropBox folder, double click on the DropBox icon on your system tray.

===Syncing through Windows Shared Folders===
If you do not bring your portable drive and you do not want to install DropBox, you can actually use a Windows Share Folder as your intermediate storage as well. Of course, the steps to do this are same as the steps mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive.

Of course, you need to setup a Windows Shared Folder in your LAN first.
