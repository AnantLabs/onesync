==Getting Started==

===The OneSync Concepts===

OneSync is based on two important concepts. These are the concepts that distinguish OneSync from other sync tools such as Live Mesh, Sync Toy and so on.

The first concept is called the *Light-weight Sync*. OneSync tries to make optimal use of the intermediate storage. Hence, only your modified files will be uploaded to or downloaded from the intermediate storage. This will not only prevent the storage of duplicated copies of your files on the intermediate storage but also make the whole sync process faster.

The second concept is known as *Half Way Sync*. Instead of doing synchronization directly between two PCs, there is an intermediate storage that plays an important role during the sync process.

When a user syncs his folder, he must first choose the location of the intermediate storage. The storage can be a folder in his portable drive, a Windows Shared Folder or a Dropbox local folder that is stored on his computer. When he does the sync on one PC, his files (or *patch*) will be sent to the intermediate storage. After that, he has to do the sync again on his other computer in order to download the *patch* from the intermediate storage and complete the sync process. It is important that the user chooses the same folder as the intermediate storage in subsequent rounds of synchronization for these couple of folders on the two different PCs.

===Getting Around===

The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see in the main window of OneSync:

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Main-GUI.jpg]

 # *Sync Job Name* - The name of your new/existing sync job.
 # *Folder To Sync* - The directory shown above is the directory of the folder that you are going to sync later. Hence, the folder is your *Sync Source Folder*.
 # *Intermediate Storage Location* - The location of intermediate storage folder, for example a folder in your thumb drive or Dropbox.
 # *Add New Job* - Add the new sync job to your collection of sync jobs so that you can do the same job again in the future.
 # *Filter Check Box* - Show only sync jobs having the folder specified in the *Folder to Sync* as Sync Source Directory.
 # *Check Box* - Check all the sync jobs that you are going to sync.
 # *Reorder* - Sort your sync jobs by clicking on the arrows. This is important if you plan to carry out more than one sync job. The sync job at the top always gets synced first. You can reorder them by using the drag-and-drop manner (as shown in the screenshot below).
 # *Edit* - Edit your sync job name and folder directories.
 # *Delete* - Delete your sync job.
 # *Preview* - Preview the sync actions that will be carried out.
 # *Show log* - Click on it to view log records for the sync folder.

You can use drag-and-drop feature to reorder sync jobs in OneSync 4.

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Drag-and-drop.jpg]

You can edit any of your sync jobs by clicking on the corresponding *Edit* button for the sync job. The main window will change as shown below:

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Edit-Sync-Job-GUI.jpg]

 # *New Job Name* - Change the name of your sync job here.
 # *Intermediate Storage Location* - Update the intermediate storage location here.
 # *Save Job* - Save and finish updating the sync job. If you decide not to save the update, you can click on other sync job to cancel the update.

The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see when you click on the *Preview* button:

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Sync-Job-Preview.jpg]

 # *Filter by Action* - Choose one from the list and the preview will only show the corresponding actions.
 # *Filter by Search* - The preview will show files whose names match the text in the box.
 # *Skip* - Skip syncing certain files.
 # *Conflict Resolution* - The way to resolve conflicts, if any.
 # *Done* - Save and close the window.

When you click on the *Sync Selected Jobs* button, the main window will start executing the sync jobs selected while it is updating their corresponding status at the same time:

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Sync.jpg]

 # *Sync Selected Jobs* - Click to start selected jobs in order.
 # *Current syncing job* - The sync job in process.
 # *Sync status* - Status of each sync job.


==Syncing My Folders==
Why put your files in different PCs and keep doing copy-and-paste whenever you update the files? Keep them synchronized between your two computers and you will always have the most up-to-date versions at hand.

===Syncing Through Portable Drive===
*Step 1*

Make sure you have plugged in the portable drive (or thumb drive) to your computer. On your PC, right-click the folder you want to sync, and click "Sync with OneSync 3". Depending on the version you are currently using, the name will be a bit different.

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Shortcut.jpg]

In OneSync 3, there is an option called "Open OneSync 3" which allows you to run the OneSync directly.

*Step 2*

The OneSync Window will pop up. The sync job name and the directory of the folder to sync will be automatically filled in if the option "Sync with OneSync 3" is chosen in the Step 1. You then just need to enter the directory of intermediate storage and click on the "Add New Job" button. After that, please click on the "Sync Selected Jobs" button to start your newly created sync job.

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Add-New-Sync-Job-Through-Shortcut.jpg]

After a few moments (unless your sync source folder is huge), the sync process will be completed successfully. =)

===Syncing Through Drop Box===

Firstly, please install Dropbox. You can find the installer at https://www.dropbox.com/downloading.

The steps are the same as the steps mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive. However, please remember that the intermediate storage path has to be your Dropbox folder directory. If you do not know what is your Dropbox folder, double click on the Dropbox icon on your system tray and the Dropbox folder will be displayed.

[http://gohchunlin.appspot.com/OneSync-Resources/OneSync4/OneSync-4-Dropbox-Tray-Icon.jpg]

===Syncing Through Windows Shared Folders===
If you do not have your portable drive and also do not want to install Dropbox, you may want to use a Windows Shared Folder as your intermediate storage as well. The steps to do this are the same as those mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive.

Of course, you need to setup a Windows Shared Folder in your LAN first.

===Sync Statuses===

As shown below, OneSync uses three colors to indicate different sync statuses:

 * Green - Everything goes smooth and OneSync finishes the sync job successfully.
 * Yellow - Special case for Dropbox folders. The sync status will turn yellow after the sync job for the Dropbox folder has been done However, do note that the PC is still interacting with the Dropbox main server, e.g. it may be uploading files in the folder to the server.
 * Red - Errors occur while syncing. Please check the status message at the top of OneSync window.

===Handling Conflicts===
You can choose different ways to handle conflicts in the *Preview* window before you do the synchronization.

For example, suppose you are working on two folders on different PCs. You modify a file on one PC and sync the folder that contains the file to the intermediate folder. Later you sync the intermediate folder with a folder on another PC which also contains the same file that also has some modifications. In this case, when you open the preview before syncing, OneSync will give you two options for this file as shown below.

 * Keep both - The file from the intermediate storage will be transferred to the folder on the second PC and renamed. The file on this PC will be left intact.
 * Overwrite - The file on the second PC will be replaced with the file from the intermediate storage.

The default operation for handling conflicts is "Keep both" when you don't go through the sync preview.

==What You Should Not Do==

In order to make sure that OneSync is working properly, you should not perform the following actions in OneSync.
 * Delete or modify the data.md file. (It will cause damage to the sync process and the user has to create a new sync job again).
 * Delete or modify content in the "files" folder located inside the intermediary storage folder.(It will lead to data loss and corruption). 
 * Delete or move the intermediate storage or source folder manually to another directory.
 * Unplug thumb drive while the sync process is ongoing. (It will lead to an incomplete sync process and may cause damage to data.md file).
 * Repeat the sync process before Dropbox finishes synchronizing with its server. (It causes data loss and leads to an incomplete sync. It is suggested to continue your next sync after Dropbox completes uploading and downloading files).
 * Open any file in source folder or intermediary folder while the sync process is ongoing. (It may cause data loss).     

If you have accidentally deleted the intermediate storage folder or accidentally edited/deleted the data.md file, you should delete the sync job which is associated with the intermediate storage folder.


==Error Messages==

Sometimes, you will see an error message displayed at the top of the window. It is highly possible that the error message is due to one of these problems:
 * You create a new job which shares the same name as one of the existing sync jobs (Just choose a new name that you have not used before).
 * There are two and only two sync jobs that are allowed to have the same intermediary storage if you are doing local sync. One job on two different PCs which has the same intermediary storage are advised to undergo an online sync or use the USB drive to sync them. (It is  recommended not to use the same intermediate storage for another sync job again).
 * The capacity of your intermediate storage is smaller than the total size of the files that OneSync is going to copy over, which are mostly your modified and newly created files. This will only happen to those users who are using portable drives as their intermediate storage. (Use another portable drive which has a capacity larger than the total size of the modified or created files)
 * The data.md file is missing or corrupted. The data.md file may be accidentally deleted or modified. It is also possible that an incomplete sync process has caused damage to data.md file. (Please delete the job and create another sync job again).
 * The data.md file is not updated because of the disk input/output problem (Please try running the program again).
 * The folder inputs (source folder or intermediary folder)are incorrect. You may choose an intermediary folder and its sub folders to be the source folder or vice versa (It is not permitted to do so). 
 * The source folder is removed or not in the directory. (The user is advised to restore the original source folder in the same directory or delete the old sync job and create a new one).
 * The intermediary folder is removed or the content inside is modified. It may cause data loss and metadata-file-not-found error. (The user is not supposed to do any modification in the intermediary folder. However, the user is allowed to choose a new folder as the intermediary folder). 
 * Sync process terminates unexpectedly. (The user can restart the sync process, if the metadata file is correctly saved. If it is corrupted, the user is advised to create a new sync job).   
 * A problem the CodeDroids members have not even spotted (Please tell us).
