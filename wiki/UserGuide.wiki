==Getting Started==

===The OneSync Concepts===

OneSync is working based on two important concepts. These are the concepts that distinguish OneSync from other sync tools such as Live Mesh, Sync Toy and so on.

The first concept is called the *Light-weight Sync*. OneSync tries to make optimal use of the intermediate storage. Hence, only your modified files will be uploaded to or downloaded from the intermediate storage. This will not only prevent storing duplicated copies of your files on the intermediate storage but also make the whole sync process faster.

The second concept is known as *Half Way Sync*. Instead of doing synchronization directly between two PCs, there is an intermediate storage that plays an important role during the sync process.

When a user syncs his folder, he must first choose the location of the intermediate storage. The storage can be a folder in his portable drive, a Windows Shared Folder or a Dropbox local folder that is stored on his computer. When he does the sync on one PC, his files (or *patch*) will be sent to the intermediate storage. After that, he has to do the sync again in his another computer in order to download the *patch* from the intermediate storage and complete the sync process. It is important that the user chooses the same folder as the intermediate storage in subsequent rounds of sync for this couple of folders  on two different PCs.

===Getting Around===

The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see in the main window of OneSync:

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~naing07/one_sync_2_0/one_sync_2_0_screenshot1.jpg]

 # *Sync Job Name* - The name of your new/existing sync job.
 # *Folder To Sync* - The directory shown above is the directory of the folder that you are going to sync later. Hence, the folder is your *Sync Source Folder*.
 # *Intermediate Storage Location* - The location of intermediate storage folder, for example a folder in your thumb drive or Dropbox.
 # *Add New Job* - Add the new sync job to your collection of sync jobs so that you can do the same job again in the future.
 # *Check Box* - Check all the sync jobs that you are going to sync.
 # *Reorder* - Sort your sync jobs by clicking on the arrows. This is important if you plan to carry out more than one sync job. The sync job at the top always gets synced first.
 # *Edit* - Edit your sync job name and folder directories.
 # *Delete* - Delete your sync job.
 # *Preview* - Preview the sync actions that will be carried out.
 # *Show log* - Click on it to view log records for the sync folder.

You can edit any of your sync jobs by clicking on the corresponding *Edit* button for the sync job. The main window will change as shown below:

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~naing07/one_sync_2_0/one_sync_2_0_screenshot2.jpg]

 # *New Job Name* - Change the name of your sync job here.
 # *Folder to Sync* - Update the sync source folder here.
 # *Intermediate Storage Location* - Update the intermediate storage location here.
 # *Save Job* - Save and finish updating the sync job.

The following diagram describes some of the things that you will see when you click on the *Preview* button:

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~naing07/one_sync_2_0/one_sync_2_0_screenshot3.jpg]

 # *Skip* - Skip syncing certain files.
 # *Filter by Action* - Choose one from the list and the preview will only show the corresponding actions.
 # *Filter by Search* - The preview will show files whose names match the text in the box.
 # *Conflict Resolution* - The way to resolve conflicts, if any.

When you click on the *Sync Selected Jobs* button, the main window will start executing the sync jobs selected while it is updating their corresponding status at the same time:

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~naing07/one_sync_2_0/one_sync_2_0_screenshot4.jpg]

 # *Sync Selected Jobs* - Click to start selected jobs in order.
 # *Current syncing job* - The sync job in process.
 # *Sync status* - Status of each sync job.


==Syncing My Folders==
Why put your files in different PCs and keep doing copy-and-paste whenever you update the files? Keep them synchronized between your two computers and you will always have the most up-to-date versions at hand.

===Syncing Through Portable Drive===
*Step 1*

Make sure you have plugged in the portable drive (or thumb drive) to your computer. On your PC, right-click the folder you want to sync, and click "Sync This Folder with OneSync". Depending on the version you are currently using, the name will be a bit different.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gohchunl/OneSync_User_Manual_03.jpg]

In OneSync V2.0, there is another option called "Open OneSync V2.0" which allows you to run the OneSync directly.

*Step 2*

The OneSync Window will pop up. Enter the profile name, directory of the folder to sync and directory of intermediate storage and click on the "Add New Job" button. After that, you can just click on the "Sync Selected Jobs" to start your newly created sync job.

[http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~naing07/one_sync_2_0/one_sync_2_0_screenshot5.jpg]

After a few moments (unless your sync source folder is huge), sync process will be done successfully. =)

===Syncing Through Drop Box===

Firstly, please install Dropbox. You can find the installer at https://www.dropbox.com/downloading.

The steps are the same as the steps mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive. However, please remember that the intermediate storage path has to be your Dropbox folder directory. If you do not know what is your Dropbox folder, double click on the Dropbox icon on your system tray and then the Dropbox folder will be displayed.

===Syncing Through Windows Shared Folders===
If you do not bring your portable drive and also do not want to install Dropbox, you may want to use a Windows Shared Folder as your intermediate storage as well. The steps to do this are the same as those mentioned in Syncing Through Portable Drive.

Of course, you need to setup a Windows Shared Folder in your LAN first.


===Handling Conflicts===
You can choose different ways to handle conflicts in the *Preview* window before you do the synchronization.

For example, suppose you are working on two folders on different PCs and keep them in sync using OneSync. You modify a file on one PC and sync the folder that contains the file to the intermediate folder. Later you sync the intermediate folder with a folder on another PC which also contains the same file that also has some modifications. In this case, when you open the preview before syncing, OneSync will give you two options for this file as shown below.

 * Keep both - The file from the intermediate storage will be transferred to the folder on the second PC and renamed leaving the file on this PC intact.
 * Overwrite - The file on the second PC will be replaced with the file from the intermediate storage.

==What You Should Not Do==

In order to make sure that OneSync is working, you should not perform the following actions in the OneSync.
 * Delete the data.md file.
 * Delete the intermediate storage.

If you accidentally delete the intermediate storage folder or accidentally edit/delete the data.md, then you should delete the profile which is associated to the intermediate storage folder in OneSync under Sync Job Management.


==Error Messages==

Sometimes, you will see an error message displayed on the top of the window. It is highly possible that due to one of these problems:
 * You create a new job name having the same name as one of the existing sync jobs (Just choose a new name that you have not used before).
 * There are more than one profile which have the same intermediate storage (Do not use back the same intermediate storage for different profile).
 * The data.md file is missing (Please uninstall and re-install).
 * The data.md file is not updated because of the IO problem (Please try run the program later).
 * A problem that the CodeDroids members do not even know (Please tell us).
