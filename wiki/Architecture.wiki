== Provider Class ==

All the providers i.e. SyncSourceProvider, SyncActionsProvider, MetadataProvider as well as SyncJobManager are abtract classes. These classes are responsible for persisting objects that they manage to storage.

In current implementation. SQLite database is for data persistence, and classes that inherits from them these abstract classes are prefixed with 'SQLite'.
