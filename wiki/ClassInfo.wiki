== !SyncJob Related Classes ==

=== !SyncJob ===

Represents information about a synchronization job. It stores information about the folder being synchronized ([ClassInfo#SyncSource SyncSource]) and the intermediary storage ([ClassInfo#IntermediaryStorage IntermediaryStorage]). A SyncJob is uniquely identified by its name on a PC. Internally, it also uses a unique id.

!SyncJobManager is used to manage SyncJob object. This includes saving and restoring a SyncJob to storage as well as modifying SyncJob information.

=== SQLiteSyncJobManager ===

The SQLiteSyncJobManager inherits from SyncJobManager abstract class. On instantiation, it will check if the database schema is created and creates it if necessary.

----

== !SyncSource Related Classes ==

=== !SyncSource ===

Encapsulates information about the folder being synchronized and possibly other information regarding the PC where the folder is. Each !SyncSource has a unique GUID. It should be noted that there can be 2 different !SyncSource object that represents the same folder on a PC. This is to allow a folder to be part of 2 different !SyncJobs.

=== SQLiteSyncSourceProvider ===

Inherits from !SyncSourceProvider abstract class. On instantiation, it will check if the database schema is created and creates it if necessary.

== !SyncActions Related Classes ==

=== !SyncAction ===

SyncAction is an abstract class. It represents actions to be taken during synchronization. Each action is associated with at least a file (to be either copied, deleted). Hence, an action contains fields related to the file it is associated with (e.g. file hash) and which id of SyncSource where the file originates from.

=== !CreateAction ===

A !CreateAction represents a file to be copied. This action is generated when a file is modified or created.

=== !DeleteAction ===

A !DeleteAction represents a file to be deleted. This action generated if a file that previously used to exist (by reading the metadata) no logner exist now.

=== !RenameAction ===

!RenameAction is currently not implemented yet.

----

== !FileMetadata Related Classes ==

=== !FileMetadata ===

Stores selected information about the file system of a folder to be synchronized. Information includes the root folder, the id of the [ClassInfo#SyncSource SyncSource] and a list of [ClassInfo#FileMetadataItem FileMetadataItem].

=== !FileMetadataItem ===

Contains specific information regarding a file like its hash code, relative file path as well as the id of [ClassInfo#SyncSource SyncSource] it originates from. It should be noted that the absolute root path of a !FileMetadataItem can be obtained by combining it with the rootFolder property of the [#ClassInfo#FileMetaData FileMetaData] it belongs to.

=== SQLiteMetadataProvider ===

SQLiteMetadataProvider inherits from MetadataProvider abstract class to persist FileMetadata to an SQLite database.

----

=== !IntermediaryStorage ===

This class represents information about the intermediary storage used for synchronization, in particular, the file path of the storage, and where the dirty files are kept.
