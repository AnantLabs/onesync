#summary Explains how OneSync works

== Introduction ==

OneSync allows 2 folders to be synchronized through an common intermediary storage such as a flashdrive. Therefore, it enables the user to perform synchronization between 2 different PCs. The common intermediary storage is not limited to flashdrive but could be any location from both PCs such as shared folder over LAN and even synchronized DropBox folder.

== Lightweight Sync ==

OneSync only stores modified/newly created files on the intermediary storage in order to maximize storage efficiency.
