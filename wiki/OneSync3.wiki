#summary What are the updates in OneSync 3?

= Introduction =

After OneSync 2.0 was released, our Google Code site which showed that OneSync is very popular. It was shortly after that enlightenment that we decided to improve the OneSync 2.0 and fix all the problems that listed in our issues page.

We are now currently working on OneSync 3 which not only have more features but also be as stable if not more so than OneSync 2.0.

OneSync 3 will be released in this summer.

== Chinese Language Support ==
There will be a Chinese version of OneSync 3 as well. This is because there are a lot of users from China, Taiwan and Malaysia who download OneSync 2.0. They are looking forward to a OneSync which supports Chinese. Hence, in the next version, we promise to deliver both English and Chinese versions of OneSync.

我们即将推出 OneSync 3 的中文版本，以方便中文使用者在使用 OneSync 时得心应手，不再有语言及文字上的困难。OneSync 3 即将在来临的夏日登场。敬请期待。
